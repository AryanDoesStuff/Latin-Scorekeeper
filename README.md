This was originally a specific card game, but it can be used in basically any game that uses chips / a method of currency

## Things it can do
- Raise bets on players regarding the winner of the game (if said player is on the sideline)
- Raise bets from players of the game, "wagers"
- The `Game` class itself is highly adaptable and can be used in many ways other than the `chipTracker` class
- Show the leaderboard
- Handle the calculations for the bets

## Use and instructions / FORMAT
- To have someone on the sideline place a bet the input must be as follows

 `0 *Player who is placing the bet* *Player they are placing it on*`

- To have a person in the game place a bet the input must be as follows

`1 *The person who is placing the bet* *Amount*`
- To declare a winner the input must be as follows

`2 *Winner*`
